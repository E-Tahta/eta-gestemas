 * @class TouchManager
 * @brief   Base class for touch manager classes.

 * management with a different library. Concrete touch managers should be able
 * to accept/reject touches and process and extract touch event info provided by
 * WindowManagerAdapter through WindowManagerAdapterListener.

 * Touch events are not replayed to other clients if the touch is accepted. All
 * touches should be either accepted or rejected in the end. Otherwise it blocks
