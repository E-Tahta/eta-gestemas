 * @class WindowManagerAdapter
 * @brief   Base class for window manager adapters.
 *
 * Window manager adapters may use different libraries to manage
 * the same window manager, or even more they may have to deal with
 * different window managers. This class defines the required pure
 * virtual methods.

 * @fn void WindowManagerAdapter::onNewEvent()
 * @brief   Dispatches new events to WindowManagerAdapterListenerInterface.
 *
 * After a call to dispatchEvents(), this method sends new events
 * to a listener of type WindowManagerAdapterListenerInterface.
 * WindowManagerAdapterListener dispatches the following events
 * to the following class instances for gesture recognition.
 * - Window created events are directed to TargetFactory.
 * - Window destroyed events are directed to GestureRecognizerManager.
 * - Touch events are directed to TouchManager.
 * WindowManagerAdapterListenerInterface can also be used for test purposes.
