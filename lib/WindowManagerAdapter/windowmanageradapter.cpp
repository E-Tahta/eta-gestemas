 * @class WindowManagerAdapter

 * Window manager adapters may use different libraries to manage
 * the same window manager, or even more they may have to deal with
 * different window managers. This class defines the required pure
 * virtual methods with a simple testing feature.

 * - Window created events are directed to TargetFactory.
 * - Window destroyed events are directed to GestureRecognizerManager.
 * - Touch events are directed to TouchManager.
